Simple plugin to have horse in minecraft usefull.

To install just frop Kon-1.0.jar file into your plugin folder ==> YourMinecraftServer/plugins

Not much to say if you need help just use "/kon help" to see all commands

I dont know if this will be update, probably no.
tested only on version 1.21.10 paper
but should work on 1.21.1 - 1.21.10 if not you can update or change.
